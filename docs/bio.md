# Cale Smith

I want to help build AGI. Currently pursuing a masters in artificial
intelligence at San Jose State. If you enjoy my writing and know of any
opportunities, shoot me an email: calepayson(at)mac.com

## Some things I'm proud of

- The research database at [InnerPlant](https://www.innerplant.com/).
- Plants that can communicate with satellites at
  [InnerPlant](https://www.innerplant.com/).
- I indipendently discovered the first major functional mutation to SARS-CoV-2,
  [D614G](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2895-3).
- An [OCR](http://www.king-dino.com/endurance/ocr.html) relay.
- An [Ironman 70.3](https://www.ironman.com/im703-santa-cruz).
- [My work in rescue](https://www.marinij.com/2013/07/22/marin-county-search-team-rescues-man-on-brink-of-waterfall-in-yosemite/).

## What I've done for work

### 2025 - Bee Partners

I was brought on as a Summer software engineering intern to help build a tool to
leverage their CRM data. The tool mirrors their CRM data in a database, uses
LLMs to enhance that data (e.g. create metadata from board decks), then
generates reports/recommended data from it.

An example use is board meeting prep. Before, a partner would manually query
their notes/emails/docs/etc. to get up to speed. Now, the tool generates a brief
based upon the partner's notes/emails/docs/etc. in a matter of seconds but also
adds some awesome supplemental info. It identifies contacts throughout the firm
that may be able to advise, help with initiatives, have experienced similar
issues, or seem to be a match for an open role. If it sounds boring, I promise,
that addition feels magical.

Since the team was me and three vibe-coding VCs I got to do a ton. When we
started the project I primarily played a dev-ops role. I was responsible for
figuring out our development protocols which is a very weird position to be in
during your first software engineering internship. I mean, I was in the
internship to learn how software is built in industry and my first task was to
teach the rest of the team how software is built in industry.

The meet of the role was building out the backend for the team. We used Supabase
and FastAPI (plus the llms) as our backend. I migrated all their CRM data to our
db and orchestrated regular syncs so that the CRM could remain the source of
truth. Then I wrote some basic APIs to be able to access the db data easily.
Because I knew it would be maintained by vibe-coders I also added some insanely
detailed logging and wrote a comprehensive test suite (learnt a ton about
mocking here).

I joke that, on paper, it was the internship from hell but it truly rocked.
The trial-by-fire experience of running dev-ops to start the internship meant
helped me some strong opinions (loosely held) that following some check list
never would have. And really, how often do interns get to lead a migration of
all of a companies data? The faith the team put in me was awesome and I have
nothing but the highest praise for them and their work (even if it was vibed).

### 2020-2023 - InnerPlant

I joined InnerPlant as the tenth hire a little over a year after it was founded.
I started as a molecular biologist but, for the simple fact that there was a
ton to do, I got to touch every aspect of the bio-development pipeline and
nearly every aspect of our research, form ideation to testing.

Two years in I joined the business team. Again, I got to dive into every
different aspect of this new field. I helped with business development,
strategy, marketing, and lead some field trials and our social strategy.

Through both these roles I got to work with our data and eventually helped build
out the biotracking database (with a wonderful colleague). When I started,
everything was tracked in independent spreadsheets. Over time we built a custom
PostgreSQL database hosted on google cloud.

While working on the database I fell in love with software and have been diving
in ever since.

### 2016-2020 - National Park Service

I worked Ocean Rescue in the Bay Area. Mostly Stinson Beach bu occasionaly
Ocean Beach. Best job I ever had. If you're in your early 20's its worth
checking out. Shoot me an email for an intro.

## What I've done just cause

### 2020 - Coronavirus Bioinformatics Lab

Covid hit during my Senior year of college and UCSC had to scramble to provide
labs that could be done remote. One of these was a bioinformatics lab focused
around Covid. It was, hands down, the coolest class I ever took. Some classes
are decades behind the industry, this one was only days behind.

We tracked the evolution of the virus through near-realtime genotyping data,
studied its structure, and built possible heritage trees to guess where it came
from (probably a lab). I got so obsessed with tracking it that I independently
discovered the mutation that was causing Europe and the East Coast to get so
walloped early in the pandemic.

### 2019-2020 - Toxic RNA Lab

The Toxic RNA Lab is an awesome hybrid lab/research opportunity that UCSC
offers. It's run by Dr. Jeremy Sanford who researches mis-splicing events (the
biological equivalent of a compiler failing to remove fragements of comments).
Genetic diseases caused by these events can be treated fairly cheaply so Dr.
Sanford is building a library of orphan diseases (diseases considered too rare
to be worth curing) in order to treat them.

I worked on a few BRCA2 mutations and loved it.

### 2012-2016 - Marin Search and Rescue

I joined SAR when I was 14 and was (briefly) the youngest full member of a SAR
team in the US. It's an incredible opportunity to do meaningful things in
beautiful places throughout California. Check it out if you have (lots of) free
time.
