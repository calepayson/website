I'm susceptible to side-quests.

Give me a language like C++ and I will spend hours researching the "proper way"
to write a class interface or constructing a completely unnecessary inheritance
hierarchy. For this reason, C is my favorite language to write. There really
aren't any side-quests in C which forces me to sit down and just write the damn
code. It's lovely.

But while C is lovely to write, it's hard to build in. C's ergonomics are
dated, forcing you to wrestle with the all encompassing make file. Its
standard library is simply missing a lot of functionality that you'll get out
of the box with other languages.

After hearing Go described as C with modern ergonomics I decided to give it a
try.

Go is not easily approachable. Look, it's not hard to approach either. But take
Rust. To learn Rust you get The Book. You read The Book. The book exposes you to
all the important Rust concepts and it's a choose your own adventure from
there.

Go, on the other hand, has a few resources, none of which brought me joy[^1].
The documentation dives right into implementing a module without any philosophy
to give it a backbone. The Tour of Go and Go by Example both felt too
impersonal, more like a bulleted list of features rather than the guiding hand
of a mentor.

Then I found The Little Go Book and, my god, it brought intense joy. It is
truly little. It clocks in at less than 90 pages and could probably be less
than 60 with some aggressive formatting. The style reminded me of The C
Programming Language; Short, to the point, efficient and yet overflowing with
soul. It is sparing with what it introduces you to and incisive with its
examples.

I read it in a day and truly felt like I had a grasp of the fundamentals of Go.
Kudos, Karl Seguin.

I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning Go.

    doing it wrong.
