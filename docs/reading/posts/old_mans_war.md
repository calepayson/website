# Old Man's War - John Scalzi

Old Man's War is not a masterpiece.

I have tendency to over-index on big serious books, novels and non-fiction. I
guess they make me feel big and serious as I read them. I also tend to not
finish them, read them in quick determined bursts of a couple pages a day, or
make it halfway through put it down for months and then struggle through the
rest in a confused haze.

Old Man's War's is short, nihilistic, and ties off loose ends and you should
definitely read it. It's got a soul, Scalzi plays with familiar tropes, calls
them out as stupid and then reenacts them because, godamn, they are tropes for
a reason.

Best of all it dodges all the pitfalls of serious Sci-Fi. It doesn't fall into
the Moby Dick trap of spending whole chapters describing well thought out
ecosystems and species but it also falls short of the absurdism of books like
A Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. It's not a book about tech and alien worlds,
rather it has simple relatable characters that happen to exist in a Sci-Fi
setting and don't feel the need to obsessively comment about it.

Old Man's War is not a masterpiece, it's fun.

I recommend it.
