I chose to switch careers from biology to software engineering because of speed.
In biology an experiment can take months or years to run. In software it usually
takes seconds. When you're early in your career that delta is the difference
between building intuition or not. At least that's what it felt like to me.

Catherine's essay felt like a better, more refined version, of what I was
thinking when I switched careers.
